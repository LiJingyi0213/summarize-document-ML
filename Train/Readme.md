# Introduction
   This folder contain all the elements for tainning model. we did not have enough computer and time to run our training model completely(3% processing). if you want to have more accuaracy model you can continue trainning it. 
   

# Learning Type
    1.  deep learning 
    2.  abstractiv text summarizers
    3.  RNN 

# Pre-requisites lib
    python 3.5
    tensorflow 1.1.0
    Numpy
    pandas
    Nltk

# Algorithm
    1.  prepare dataset 
    2.  data pre-processing
        a. cleaning
        b. Tokenization
        c. word embedding using conceptNet Numberbatch
        d. vectorization 
    3.  Designing LSTM Bi-directional Encoders & Deconders
    4.  Train and  testing then save the model
    5.  Take user input and summarize document 



# Dataset for Training 
    1.  Amazon-Fine-Food-Review 
    2.  DUC (document Understanding Conference) dataset 
    3.  CNN / Daily Mail Dataset
    4.  Gigaword Dataset
